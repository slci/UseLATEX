# add_latex_document(<tex_file>
#                    [BIBFILES <bib_files>]
#                    [INPUTS <input_tex_files>]
#                    [IMAGE_DIRS] <image_directories>
#                    [IMAGES] <image_files>
#                    [CONFIGURE] <tex_files>
#                    [DEPENDS] <tex_files>
#                    [MULTIBIB_NEWCITES] <suffix_list>
#                    [USE_INDEX] [USE_GLOSSARY] [USE_NOMENCL]
#                    [FORCE_PDF] [FORCE_DVI] [FORCE_HTML]
#                    [EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL]
#                    [MANGLE_TARGET_NAMES])
#       Adds targets that compile <tex_file>.  The latex output is placed
#       in LATEX_OUTPUT_PATH or CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR if the former is
#       not set.  The latex program is picky about where files are located,
#       so all input files are copied from the source directory to the
#       output directory.  This includes the target tex file, any tex file
#       listed with the INPUTS option, the bibliography files listed with
#       the BIBFILES option, and any .cls, .bst, and .clo files found in
#       the current source directory.  Images found in the IMAGE_DIRS
#       directories or listed by IMAGES are also copied to the output
#       directory and coverted to an appropriate format if necessary.  Any
#       tex files also listed with the CONFIGURE option are also processed
#       with the CMake CONFIGURE_FILE command (with the @ONLY flag).  Any
#       file listed in CONFIGURE but not the target tex file or listed with
#       INPUTS has no effect. DEPENDS can be used to specify generated files
#       that are needed to compile the latex target.
#
#       The following targets are made:
#               dvi: Makes <name>.dvi
#               pdf: Makes <name>.pdf using pdflatex.
#               safepdf: Makes <name>.pdf using ps2pdf.  If using the default
#                       program arguments, this will ensure all fonts are
#                       embedded and no lossy compression has been performed
#                       on images.
#               ps: Makes <name>.ps
#               html: Makes <name>.html
#               auxclean: Deletes <name>.aux and other auxiliary files.
#                       This is sometimes necessary if a LaTeX error occurs
#                       and writes a bad aux file.  Unlike the regular clean
#                       target, it does not delete other input files, such as
#                       converted images, to save time on the rebuild.
#
#       THIS DOCUMENTATION NEEDS TO CHANGE!!!!!
#       The dvi target is added to the ALL.  That is, it will be the target
#       built by default.  If the DEFAULT_PDF argument is given, then the
#       pdf target will be the default instead of dvi.  Likewise,
#       DEFAULT_SAFEPDF sets the default target to safepdf.  If NO_DEFAULT
#       is specified, then no target will be added to ALL, which is
#       convenient when including LaTeX documentation with something else.
#
#       If the argument MANGLE_TARGET_NAMES is given, then each of the
#       target names above will be mangled with the <tex_file> name.  This
#       is to make the targets unique if add_latex_document is called for
#       multiple documents.  If the argument USE_INDEX is given, then
#       commands to build an index are made.  If the argument USE_GLOSSARY
#       is given, then commands to build a glossary are made.  If the
#       argument MULTIBIB_NEWCITES is given, then additional bibtex calls
#       are added to the build to support the extra auxiliary files created
#       with the \newcite command in the multibib package.
#
# History:
#
# 2.0.0 First major revision of UseLATEX.cmake updates to more recent features
#       of CMake and some non-backward compatible changes.
#
#       Changed all function and macro names to lower case. CMake's identifiers
#       are case insensitive, but the convention moved from all upper case to
#       all lower case somewhere around the release of CMake 2. (The original
#       version of UseLATEX.cmake predates that.)
#
#       Remove condition matching in if statements. They are no longer necessary
#       and are even discouraged (because else clauses get confusing).
#
#       Use "new" features available in CMake such as list and argument parsing.
#
#       Remove some code that has been deprecated for a while.
#
#       Mark variables for compiler and converter executables as advanced to
#       match the more conventional CMake behavior.
#
#       Change how default builds are specified and add the ability to force
#       a particular build.
#
# 1.10.5 Fix for Window's convert check (thanks to Martin Baute).
#
# 1.10.4 Copy font files to binary directory for packages that come with
#       their own fonts.
#
# 1.10.3 Check for Windows version of convert being used instead of
#       ImageMagick's version (thanks to Martin Baute).
#
# 1.10.2 Use htlatex as a fallback when latex2html is not available (thanks
#       to Tomasz Grzegurzko).
#
# 1.10.1 Make convert program mandatory only if actually used (thanks to
#       Julien Schueller).
#
# 1.10.0 Added NO_DEFAULT and DEFAULT_PS options.
#       Fixed issue with cleaning files for LaTeX documents originating in
#       a subdirectory.
#
# 1.9.6 Fixed problem with LATEX_SMALL_IMAGES.
#       Strengthened check to make sure the output directory does not contain
#       the source files.
#
# 1.9.5 Add support for image types not directly supported by either latex
#       or pdflatex.  (Thanks to Jorge Gerardo Pena Pastor for SVG support.)
#
# 1.9.4 Fix issues with filenames containing multiple periods.
#
# 1.9.3 Hide some variables that are now cached but should not show up in
#       the ccmake list of variables.
#
# 1.9.2 Changed MACRO declarations to FUNCTION declarations.  The better
#       FUNCTION scoping will hopefully avoid some common but subtle bugs.
#       This implicitly increases the minimum CMake version to 4.6 (although
#       I honestly only test it with the latest 4.8 version).
#
#       Since we are updating the minimum CMake version, I'm going to start
#       using the builtin LIST commands that are now available.
#
#       Favor using pdftops from the Poppler package to convert from pdf to
#       eps.  It does a much better job than ImageMagick or ghostscript.
#
# 1.9.1 Fixed typo that caused the LATEX_SMALL_IMAGES option to fail to
#       activate.
#
# 1.9.0 Add support for the multibib package (thanks to Antonio LaTorre).
#
# 1.8.2 Fix corner case when an argument name was also a variable containing
#       the text of an argument.  In this case, the CMake IF was matching
#       the argument text with the contents of the variable with the same
#       argument name.
#
# 1.8.1 Fix problem where ps2pdf was not getting the appropriate arguments.
#
# 1.8.0 Add support for synctex.
#
# 1.7.7 Support calling xindy when making glossaries.
#
#       Improved make clean support.
#
# 1.7.6 Add support for the nomencl package (thanks to Myles English).
#
# 1.7.5 Fix issue with bibfiles being copied two different ways, which causes
#       Problems with dependencies (thanks to Edwin van Leeuwen).
#
# 1.7.4 Added the DEFAULT_SAFEPDF option (thanks to Raymond Wan).
#
#       Added warnings when image directories are not found (and were
#       probably not given relative to the source directory).
#
# 1.7.3 Fix some issues with interactions between makeglossaries and bibtex
#       (thanks to Mark de Wever).
#
# 1.7.2 Use ps2pdf to convert eps to pdf to get around the problem with
#       ImageMagick dropping the bounding box (thanks to Lukasz Lis).
#
# 1.7.1 Fixed some dependency issues.
#
# 1.7.0 Added DEPENDS options (thanks to Theodore Papadopoulo).
#
# 1.6.1 Ported the makeglossaries command to CMake and embedded the port
#       into UseLATEX.cmake.
#
# 1.6.0 Allow the use of the makeglossaries command.  Thanks to Oystein
#       S. Haaland for the patch.
#
# 1.5.0 Allow any type of file in the INPUTS lists, not just tex file
#       (suggested by Eric Noulard).  As a consequence, the ability to
#       specify tex files without the .tex extension is removed.  The removed
#       function is of dubious value anyway.
#
#       When copying input files, skip over any file that exists in the
#       binary directory but does not exist in the source directory with the
#       assumption that these files were added by some other mechanism.  I
#       find this useful when creating large documents with multiple
#       chapters that I want to build separately (for speed) as I work on
#       them.  I use the same boilerplate as the starting point for all
#       and just copy it with different configurations.  This was what the
#       separate ADD_LATEX_DOCUMENT method was supposed to originally be for.
#       Since its external use is pretty much deprecated, I removed that
#       documentation.
#
# 1.4.1 Copy .sty files along with the other class and package files.
#
# 1.4.0 Added a MANGLE_TARGET_NAMES option that will mangle the target names.
#
#       Fixed problem with copying bib files that became apparent with
#       CMake 2.4.
#
# 1.3.0 Added a LATEX_OUTPUT_PATH variable that allows you or the user to
#       specify where the built latex documents to go.  This is especially
#       handy if you want to do in-source builds.
#
#       Removed the ADD_LATEX_IMAGES macro and absorbed the functionality
#       into ADD_LATEX_DOCUMENT.  The old interface was always kind of
#       clunky anyway since you had to specify the image directory in both
#       places.  It also made supporting LATEX_OUTPUT_PATH problematic.
#
#       Added support for jpeg files.
#
# 1.2.0 Changed the configuration options yet again.  Removed the NO_CONFIGURE
#       Replaced it with a CONFIGURE option that lists input files for which
#       configure should be run.
#
#       The pdf target no longer depends on the dvi target.  This allows you
#       to build latex documents that require pdflatex.  Also added an option
#       to make the pdf target the default one.
#
# 1.1.1 Added the NO_CONFIGURE option.  The @ character can be used when
#       specifying table column separators.  If two or more are used, then
#       will incorrectly substitute them.
#
# 1.1.0 Added ability include multiple bib files.  Added ability to do copy
#       sub-tex files for multipart tex files.
#
# 1.0.0 If both ps and pdf type images exist, just copy the one that
#       matches the current render mode.  Replaced a bunch of STRING
#       commands with GET_FILENAME_COMPONENT commands that were made to do
#       the desired function.
#
# 0.4.0 First version posted to CMake Wiki.
